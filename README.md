# gs-bar
#### GS Bar is an i3bar clone for gnome shell

From the i3bar man page:

```i3bar displays a bar at the bottom (or top) of your monitor(s) containing workspace switching buttons and a statusline generated by i3status(1) or similar. It is automatically invoked (and configured through) i3. i3bar supports colors via a JSON protocol starting from v4.2, see http://i3wm.org/docs/i3bar-protocol.html```

GS Bar is based on the [Frippery Bottom Panel](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3/bottom-panel/) and [Freon](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/841/freon/) Gnome Shell Extensions.
